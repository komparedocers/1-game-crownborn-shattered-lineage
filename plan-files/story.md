# Crownborn: Shattered Lineage — Story Bible
**Version:** 2025-11-08T18:48:28Z  
**Narrative Lead:** You  
**Intended Tone:** Cinematic, hopeful, and relentless; a tale about ordinary courage confronting a rigged destiny.

## 1) High‑Concept
An ordinary child from the river quarter is thrust into a continent‑wide rescue when an iron‑fisted conqueror, **Warlord Bollock**, abducts their entire extended family in one night raid. Each rescue uncovers a thread of a buried truth: the player character is **the last living heir** to a line extinguished during the Great Sundering—its crown shattered into three **Sigils**. The child grows into their birthright not by decree but by **deeds**—saving kin, freeing towns, and unseating terror, stage by stage.

Two playable perspectives change the relational texture of the journey:
- **Boy Protagonist**: rescues skew toward **adult women relatives** (aunts, sisters, cousins), then men, then children—presented respectfully and non‑sexualized.
- **Girl Protagonist**: rescues skew toward **children**, then men, then women.

Regardless of choice, the truth lands the same at **Stage 2**: “You are **Crownborn**.”

## 2) World & Lore

### 2.1 The Realm of Shards
Centuries after the Great Sundering split the royal diadem, the realm fell into **City‑States** ruled by merchants, militias, and mystics. Trade routes stitch ports, mines, and orchards, but behind the fairs and festivals simmer debts, old massacres, and **oaths** never kept.

- **Ashenport Docks** — Fire‑scarred quay; smugglers turn freedom brokers by night.
- **Obsidian Bazaar** — Markets under black glass awnings; rumor is hard currency.
- **Stormglass Keep** — Lightning farms crown the cliffs; power and peril married.
- **Whispering Marsh** — Bulrush cathedrals; the fog carries voices not your own.
- **Rivergate** — Piers braided like fingers; a city that floats and remembers.

*(Full list mirrors mission locations used in the campaign files.)*

### 2.2 The Crown & The Sigils
The monarchy died, but the **Crown’s will** did not. The diadem split into **three Sigils**—**Heart**, **Hand**, and **Horizon**—each anchoring a principle of rule:
- **Heart** guards the people from the ruler.
- **Hand** binds the ruler to the law.
- **Horizon** obliges the ruler to the future they cannot yet see.

Legends say the Sigils awaken only for a **line true in duty**—measured not in blood alone but in the **saving of lives**. That is why rescues matter.

### 2.3 Warlord Bollock
A warfoundling of the old border wars, Bollock rose by seizing supply chains, corralling labor into **road‑forts**, and **harvesting fear**. He believes the realm must be **forged** anew under iron. He wants the Sigils, but lacking the birthright, he coerces **line‑threads**—families who once served the royal household—hoping to brute‑force a path to legitimacy.

### 2.4 The Shaman
An old river‑sage of no name who appears at storms and crossroads. Neither royalist nor rebel, the Shaman serves the **Balance**. Their counsel is terse and practical, like a wedge slipped under a stuck door.

## 3) Protagonist Arc
- **Act I — The Spark (Stages 1–20)**  
  The raid shatters normal life. The first rescues are frantic, local, and close to home. You learn to move, hide, parry, and **believe**. At **Stage 2**, an elder (Aunt or Uncle) gives the **revelation**: *“Your blood remembers thrones.”* Denial. Anger. Then resolve.

- **Act II — The Long Rescue (Stages 21–80)**  
  You range outward: mines, keeps, marshes, markets. You dismantle supply lines and free work gangs. The **first Sigil—Heart—**stirs at **Stage 50** after a rescue that requires mercy for an enemy camp of press‑ganged conscripts.

- **Act III — The Unforgiving Middle (Stages 81–120)**  
  Bollock adapts. Patrols get smarter. Elites hold the stairwells. You raid while hunted. The **second Sigil—Hand—**awakens at **Stage 100** when you refuse an expedient cruelty and choose law over vengeance in a contested town.

- **Act IV — The Horizon (Stages 121–150)**  
  With two Sigils lit, you storm the last chain of bases feeding **Stormglass Keep**. The **third Sigil—Horizon—**answers at **Stage 150** during the final ascent, when you choose a route that preserves a dam from sabotaged collapse, saving a valley you might never see again.

Through it all, you remain who you started as—**ordinary, but choosing**.

## 4) Narrative Systems That Drive Play

### 4.1 The Family Thread
Each stage centers on a **single relative** with a tiny life beyond their capture: a fisher with a rope trick, a tutor who taught geometry with chalk on crates, a little cousin who keeps a pebble journal. Rescuing them yields a **next‑mission lead** and a **power spark**. The tone is humane; humor shows up like a lantern in rain.

### 4.2 Powers as Memory
The powers are not “loot beams” so much as **remembered crafts** of the line:
- **Blink Step** — stepping where you meant to be all along.
- **Shadow Veil** — walking like a rumor between moments.
- **Time Slip** — the breath you take before the hammer falls.
- **Aerial Glide / Sky Ascent** — roofs teach a different map.
- **Stoneguard** — stubbornness that refuses to break.
- **Hawkeye Burst / Thunderbrand / Ember Dash / Frostlock / Chain Grapple / Viper Strike / Spectral Decoy / Sanctum Ward** — each a verb the line once spoke.  
As rescues mount, these words string into **sentences** of motion and intent.

### 4.3 Boss Truths
Every boss is a person bent around a wound:
- **General Krath**, who trusts storms more than men; ground him.  
- **Matron Vess**, who builds mirrors to see past her choices; approach unseen.  
- **High Warlock Zev**, who chants so he cannot listen; interrupt him.  
- **Corsair Queen Nyra**, who welded herself to an engine that cannot stop; unbolt her myth.  
*(And others—each fight has a readable, mercifully learnable weakness.)*

### 4.4 The Map Before the March
Each mission begins with a **map reveal**—vents, culverts, rafters, and zip‑lines. The map is **not a spoiler**; it is a promise: *There is a way if you will learn to look.* Secret doors are not magic—just **forgotten maintenance** and **human shortcuts**.

### 4.5 The Shaman’s Wisdom
A single line per stage. Enough to tilt the world two degrees. Examples:
- “Every fortress has a forgotten vein; feel for its pulse.”
- “Count the steps of your fear, then step once more.”
- “Your blood remembers thrones; let your heart remember people.”

## 5) Act Breaks & Signature Moments

### Stage 2 — **Name of the Line**
In a cramped storehouse as rain claps the tin roof, your elder presses a palm to your brow and whispers the **oath of the line**. The UI does not freeze; enemies still search outside. You learn that destiny is a thing you must **carry while moving**.

### Stage 37 — **Ember Barges**
You cross the river on tar‑black barges while **Razor Eagles** wheel. The trick is the **waterwheel ducts** under the mill pier—a wet crawl that takes your breath and your pursuers’ angles.

### Stage 50 — **The Sigil of Heart**
The boss is a captain who conscripted children to carry powder. You win faster by **freeing porters mid‑fight**, disrupting his tactic. As the last chain falls, an emblem like a **heartbeat** pulses in your HUD. Heart recognizes a ruler who shelters **first**.

### Stage 73 — **Stormcaller’s Choir**
A weather machine built from salvaged bells draws lightning across the plaza. You two‑step through thunder, cut wires with **Thunderbrand**, and hear the bells slow to something like a song.

### Stage 100 — **The Sigil of Hand**
You capture a magistrate who begs for quick punishment. Instead you **bind** him to testify and **reopen trials** for the disappeared. The Sigil of Hand warms—law before wrath.

### Stage 150 — **The Sigil of Horizon**
As Stormglass Keep cracks and the dam booms, you choose the high sluice to vent pressure rather than sprint the short kill route. The valley lights stay on. The third Sigil opens like dawn beyond your shoulder.

## 6) The Final Confrontation

### 6.1 Approach
Stormglass is not a single fight; it’s a **climb through industry**. You ascend past turbines, couplings, and the sleeping barracks of men who think they cannot leave. Messages from rescued kin arrive as short **radio bursts**: makeshift intel, jokes, small prayers.

### 6.2 The Duel with Bollock
Bollock fights like a man who **outlived** his usefulness. He hits hard, covers his weakness with noise, and speaks in certainties he no longer believes. The duel is staged on the **collector bridge** with lightning crawling over the rails.

- **Phase 1:** You break the **conductive chains** that anchor his armor to stolen power.  
- **Phase 2:** He floods the bridge with conscripts; you refuse to kill them, using **Spectral Decoy** and **Shadow Veil** to disarm and scatter.  
- **Phase 3:** Alone at last, he swings a hammer of soldered insignias; you **parry‑parry‑perfect**, the window your Shaman taught you to watch.

### 6.3 Endings
- **Mercy Ending (True Crown)**: You chain him alive to a gurney, wheel him past the conscripts, and **unbind the oath‑press**. The crowd disperses—not conquered, but **unchained**. The Sigils fuse to a diadem only **you refuse to wear**; you set it on a plinth in the **Public Ledger Hall**. A crown that watches rulers, not the other way around.
- **Iron Ending**: If you lean into execution and domination throughout, you break him and the dam both. The valley drowns. The diadem seals; the Shaman turns away. You rule, but the story ends colder.
- **Wanderer Ending**: If you keep refusing titles, the Sigils follow like moons in your wake. The realm governs itself; you move on—**a rumor in clean air**.

*(All endings respect player choice; none contradict the main arc.)*

## 7) Themes & Motifs
- **Ordinary courage** over inherited privilege.  
- **Law as mercy**, not punishment first.  
- **Maps as empathy**—to know a place is to know its shortcuts.  
- **Power as memory**—you are not learning magic; you are remembering duties.  
- **Lightning & Water** recur: storms break tyrants, and rivers carry news.

---

## 8) Characters (Select)

- **The Protagonist (Boy/Girl)** — Wide‑eyed, stubborn, surprisingly funny when exhausted.  
- **Aunt Leena / Uncle Joran** — First anchors; the throne revealers.  
- **Sister Mira / Brother Kael** — Street‑clever scouts who teach you to play the city like an instrument.  
- **Cousin Aria / Daro** — The one who keeps score in pebbles.  
- **The Shaman** — A midwife of choices. Never tells, always shows how to look.  
- **Bollock** — A builder who mistook **control** for **care** and never learned the difference.

*(Relatives rotate per stage; see mission data for names.)*

---

## 9) Structure & Pacing

- **150 Stages** split across 4 Acts; each stage: **Ingress → Pressure → Pivot → Boss → Rescue → Lead**.  
- **Pressure** means 360° threats—animals from dark edges, soldiers from catwalks, elites on timers.  
- **Pivot** is the design moment: a secret door found, a machine toggled, a tide turned.

Music swells for **rescue**, not kills. The loudest sound is sometimes a **lock clicking open**.

---

## 10) Post‑Game & New Game+

- **New Game+**: Keep powers, add **Sigil Trials**—optional challenges that explore ethics of power (save more at cost of time; prove law under pressure; choose future over present gain).  
- **Hardcore**: 3 lives total for the **entire run**; leaderboard emblem.  
- **Story Codex**: Rescued relatives contribute recipes, knots, slang, prayers—**people’s history** unlocked as you play.

---

## 11) Sample Cinematics (Text Boards)

- **Opening**: “They took them when the rain began. I counted the lanterns. I counted my breath. I ran.”  
- **Act I End**: “Maps are not walls. They are **doors** you have not opened yet.” —The Shaman  
- **Act III Mid**: “I could have ended him. I chose the oath instead. My hands wouldn’t stop shaking.”  
- **Final**: “A crown is a promise that outlives us. Mind the promise.”

---

## 12) Narrative Integration With Systems

- **Power unlocks** mirror the relatives’ lives (the climber aunt aligns with **Chain Grapple**, the night‑watch brother with **Shadow Veil**, the stonemason cousin with **Stoneguard**).  
- **Boss weaknesses** are hinted by environmental storytelling (overheated forges, caged hawks, mirror angles, engine sounds).  
- **Sigils** trigger at humane choices that align with their oaths, not raw combat power.

---

## 13) Content Boundaries

- Presented with **respect**: no sexualization; violence is stylized and focused on **liberation**.  
- Children are never harmed on screen; rescue and de‑escalation are emphasized where possible.  
- Enemies are often coerced locals; the story recognizes systems as much as individuals.

## 14) One‑Page Synopsis

When a warlord steals your family to bait a dead crown awake, you chase lanterns through rain and smoke, learning to move like wind and promise. You rescue one person at a time, and each adds a word to your language of power—until you can speak sentences that topple keeps. At the mountain’s lip, lightning on the rails, you refuse the simple victory to save the valley. Three Sigils open. A crown awakens. Whether you wear it is the last choice—and it says more about the realm than about you.
