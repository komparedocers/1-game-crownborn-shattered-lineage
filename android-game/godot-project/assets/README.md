## Creating Assets
See `ASSET_CREATION_GUIDE.md` in the root directory for:
- Blender modeling workflow
- Texture creation
- Export settings
- Import to Godot

## Current State
The game currently uses **procedural placeholder assets** generated by `ProceduralAssets.gd`. Replace these with your custom models to make the game production-ready.
